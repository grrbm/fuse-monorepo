# Chart X-Axis Display Update

## ✅ Changes Complete

The analytics chart now displays X-axis labels **every 3 days** with the **last day always shown**, making the chart cleaner and easier to read.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before
- X-axis showed labels for **every single day** (30+ labels on "Last Month" view)
- Labels were crowded and overlapping
- Hard to read specific dates

### After
- X-axis shows labels **every 3 days** (day 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28)
- **First day always shown** (Sept 1)
- **Last day always shown** (Sept 30) - even if it doesn't align with the 3-day interval
- All daily data points still plotted (just fewer labels)
- Clean, readable, proportional spacing

---

## 📊 Example: September (30 days)

**X-axis labels shown:**
- Sept 1 (first day - always shown)
- Sept 4 (every 3rd day: index 3)
- Sept 7 (every 3rd day: index 6)
- Sept 10 (every 3rd day: index 9)
- Sept 13 (every 3rd day: index 12)
- Sept 16 (every 3rd day: index 15)
- Sept 19 (every 3rd day: index 18)
- Sept 22 (every 3rd day: index 21)
- Sept 25 (every 3rd day: index 24)
- Sept 28 (every 3rd day: index 27)
- Sept 30 (last day - always shown, even though index 29)

**Total labels:** 11 labels for 30 days (previously 30 labels)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

**File:** `fuse-admin-frontend/components/store-analytics.tsx`

### 1. **Custom Ticks Array**
```typescript
// Generate custom ticks: show every 3rd day + always include first and last
const customTicks = formattedData.reduce((acc: string[], point, index) => {
  const isFirst = index === 0;
  const isLast = index === formattedData.length - 1;
  const isEveryThird = index % 3 === 0;
  
  // Include first, last, or every 3rd day
  if (isFirst || isLast || isEveryThird) {
    acc.push(point.name);
  }
  
  return acc;
}, []);
```

### 2. **Updated XAxis Component**
```typescript
<XAxis
  dataKey="name"
  axisLine={false}
  tickLine={false}
  tick={{ fontSize: 12, fill: "hsl(var(--muted-foreground))" }}
  ticks={customTicks}          // ← Custom tick array
  angle={0}                    // ← Horizontal labels
  height={60}                  // ← Enough space for labels
/>
```

## 📈 Chart Behavior by View

### "Last Month" (30 days)
- Shows: ~11 labels (every 3 days + first/last)
- Example: Sept 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 30

### "This Month" (varies)
- Shows: proportional labels (every 3 days + first/last)
- Example for Oct 1-16: Oct 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16

### "Last 7 Days"
- Shows: ~4 labels (every 3 days + first/last)
- Example: Oct 10, 13, 16 (includes first and last)

### Custom Ranges
- Always shows first and last date
- Shows every 3rd day in between
- Adapts to any date range length

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Clean, readable chart with no label crowding
2. **Proportional Spacing**: Labels appear evenly distributed
3. **Complete Data**: All daily data points still plotted (just fewer labels)
4. **Smart Logic**: Always includes first and last day for context
5. **Flexible**: Works for any date range (7 days, 30 days, 90 days, etc.)

## 🧪 Testing

✅ Build successful: `pnpm build` in fuse-admin-frontend
✅ No linter errors
✅ TypeScript compilation passed
✅ All data points still plotted (just fewer X-axis labels)

---

## 📝 Summary

The chart now displays **every 3rd day** on the X-axis (with first and last always shown), making it much easier to read while maintaining all the daily data points. This creates a cleaner, more professional-looking chart that scales well across different date ranges.

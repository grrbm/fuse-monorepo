# Last Month Date Range - Always Complete Calendar Month

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The "Last Month" preset now **always shows the complete calendar month** (1st to last day of the previous month) and **automatically updates when a new month starts**.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Current Behavior (October 16, 2025)

When you click **"Last Month"**, the system:

1. **Gets current date**: October 16, 2025
2. **Calculates previous month**: September 2025
3. **Sets start date**: September 1, 2025 (00:00:00)
4. **Sets end date**: September 30, 2025 (23:59:59)
5. **Displays chart**: All 30 days of September

### Automatic Updates as Months Pass

| Today's Date | "Last Month" Shows |
|--------------|-------------------|
| October 16, 2025 | **Sept 1 - Sept 30** (30 days) |
| November 5, 2025 | **Oct 1 - Oct 31** (31 days) |
| December 20, 2025 | **Nov 1 - Nov 30** (30 days) |
| January 15, 2026 | **Dec 1 - Dec 31** (31 days) |
| February 10, 2026 | **Jan 1 - Jan 31** (31 days) |
| March 3, 2026 | **Feb 1 - Feb 28** (28 days, or 29 in leap years) |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

**File:** `fuse-admin-frontend/components/date-range-selector.tsx`

### Key Code Logic

```typescript
case 'lastmonth':
  // Previous month: Always start on 1st and end on last day of previous month
  // This ensures we always show the COMPLETE calendar month
  const year = now.getFullYear();
  const month = now.getMonth();
  
  // First day of previous month
  newStart = new Date(year, month - 1, 1);
  newStart.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  
  // Last day of previous month (day 0 of current month)
  newEnd = new Date(year, month, 0);
  newEnd.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  break;
```

### How It Calculates Last Day

JavaScript's `Date` constructor has a special behavior:
- `new Date(year, month, 0)` = **last day of previous month**
- Example: `new Date(2025, 10, 0)` = October 31, 2025 (day 0 of November = last day of October)

This automatically handles:
- ✅ 30-day months (September, April, June, November)
- ✅ 31-day months (January, March, May, July, August, October, December)
- ✅ 28/29-day February (leap years handled automatically)

---

## 📊 Date Normalization

All dates are normalized to ensure consistent behavior:

### Start Date
- Set to **00:00:00.000** (midnight at start of day)
- Ensures all data from the 1st is included

### End Date
- Set to **23:59:59.999** (last millisecond of day)
- Ensures all data from the last day is included

### Custom Dates
- Also normalized to full day ranges
- Prevents timezone and partial-day issues

---

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Predictable**: Always shows complete calendar months
2. **Automatic**: Updates when new month starts (no manual intervention)
3. **Accurate**: Handles varying month lengths (28, 29, 30, 31 days)
4. **Timezone-safe**: All dates normalized to prevent edge cases
5. **User-friendly**: Intuitive behavior that matches user expectations

## 📈 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: View September Data (Today: Oct 16)
- Click "Last Month"
- Shows: **Sept 1 - Sept 30** (all 30 days)
- Chart displays: Daily data for all of September

### Scenario 2: Month Changes Overnight
- **Oct 31, 11:59 PM**: "Last Month" shows Sept 1-30
- **Nov 1, 12:01 AM**: "Last Month" automatically shows Oct 1-31
- No code changes needed - updates automatically

### Scenario 3: February (Leap Year)
- **Today: March 10, 2024** (leap year)
- "Last Month" shows: **Feb 1 - Feb 29** (29 days)
- **Today: March 10, 2025** (non-leap year)
- "Last Month" shows: **Feb 1 - Feb 28** (28 days)

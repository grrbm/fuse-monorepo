# Daily Hover Data - Chart Implementation

## Overview
The chart now displays **individual daily data** on hover, not aggregated intervals. This provides granular insights while maintaining a clean visual presentation.

## Key Features

### 1. **Clean Line Graph**
- ✅ No dots/circles on the line
- ✅ Smooth continuous line
- ✅ Professional, minimalist appearance

### 2. **Interactive Hover**
- ✅ Hover over any point to see data for that specific day
- ✅ Shows exact date (e.g., "Oct 12")
- ✅ Shows daily revenue or orders for that single day
- ✅ Large dot appears on hover (6px radius with white stroke)

### 3. **Daily Data Precision**
- ✅ Each data point represents ONE day
- ✅ No aggregation or summing of multiple days
- ✅ Tooltip shows exact daily performance

## Visual Behavior by View

### Last 7 Days
**X-axis Labels**: All 7 days shown
**Data Points**: 7 individual days
**Hover**: Shows data for each specific day
```
X-axis: Oct 10, Oct 11, Oct 12, Oct 13, Oct 14, Oct 15, Oct 16
Hover on Oct 12: "Oct 12 - Revenue: $1,234"
```

### Last Month (September - 30 days)
**X-axis Labels**: Every 3rd day (Sep 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 30)
**Data Points**: All 30 individual days (not shown on x-axis)
**Hover**: Shows data for each specific day, even days not labeled
```
X-axis shows: Sep 1, 4, 7, 10...
But hovering over Sep 2 shows: "Sep 2 - Revenue: $850"
But hovering over Sep 5 shows: "Sep 5 - Revenue: $1,200"
```

### This Month (October - 31 days)
**X-axis Labels**: Every 3rd day (Oct 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31)
**Data Points**: All 31 individual days
**Hover**: Shows data for each specific day

**Historical (Oct 1-16)**: Blue solid line, actual daily data
**Projected (Oct 17-31)**: Grey dashed line, expected subscription renewals per day

```
Hover on Oct 3: "Oct 3 - Actual Revenue: $950"
Hover on Oct 18: "Oct 18 - Expected (Subscriptions): $450"
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Each point represents ONE day
chartData = [
  { date: '2025-10-01', revenue: 1250, orders: 12 },
  { date: '2025-10-02', revenue: 890, orders: 8 },
  { date: '2025-10-03', revenue: 1430, orders: 15 },
  // ... continues for every single day
]
```

### X-Axis Strategy
- **Data**: Keep ALL daily data points (not aggregated)
- **Labels**: Show subset of labels for readability
  - Short ranges (≤14 days): Show all labels
  - Month views: Show every 3rd day + first + last
  - This prevents label overcrowding while preserving data

### Line Configuration
```typescript
<Line
  type="monotone"
  dataKey="historicalValue"
  stroke="hsl(var(--primary))"
  strokeWidth={2}
  dot={false}  // No dots on line
  activeDot={{ r: 6, fill: "hsl(var(--primary))", stroke: "white", strokeWidth: 2 }}  // Shows on hover
  connectNulls={false}
/>
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Precise Data Access**
Users can hover over ANY day to see exact performance, not just labeled days

### 2. **Clean Visualization**
No visual clutter from dots, clean professional line graph

### 3. **Granular Insights**
See daily fluctuations and trends at a daily level

### 4. **Better UX**
- Easy to spot trends
- Interactive exploration of data
- Hover reveals details on demand

## Tooltip Information

### Revenue Mode
- **Historical**: "Oct 12 - Actual Revenue: $1,234"
- **Projected**: "Oct 18 - Expected (Subscriptions): $450"

### Orders Mode
- **Historical**: "Oct 12 - Orders: 15"
- **Projected**: Not shown (only in revenue mode)

## Technical Notes

### Y-Axis Scaling
- Scales based on highest daily value (not aggregated totals)
- Rounds to nearest $100 for revenue, nearest 10 for orders
- Shows 5 evenly spaced tick marks

### Performance
- Rendering 30-31 data points per month
- Smooth hover interactions
- No noticeable performance impact

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- Hover states fully supported
- Touch devices: tap to see tooltip

## User Instructions

**To view daily data:**
1. Hover your mouse over any point on the line
2. A dot will appear at that location
3. A tooltip shows the exact date and value
4. Move along the line to see different days

**Note**: Even if a day isn't labeled on the x-axis, you can still hover over it to see its data!

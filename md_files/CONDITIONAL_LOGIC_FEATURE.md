# Conditional Logic Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Built complete conditional logic system for questionnaires, allowing follow-up questions to appear based on specific answer selections.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API ✅

**Updated Files:**
- `packages/validators/src/question.schema.ts` - Added conditional fields to validation
- `patient-api/src/services/question.service.ts` - Added conditional logic handling
- `patient-api/src/main.ts` - Updated POST /questions endpoint

**New Fields Supported:**
```typescript
{
  conditionalLogic: "answer_equals:yes",  // Logic rule
  conditionalLevel: 1,                    // Nesting depth (0=main, 1+=conditional)
  subQuestionOrder: 1,                    // Order within conditional group
  parentQuestionId: "uuid"                // Reference to parent question
}
```

### 2. Form Editor UI ✅

**File:** `fuse-tenant-portal-frontend/pages/forms/editor/[id].tsx`

**New UI Elements:**
- **"Add Conditional Logic" button** appears below each question when editing
- **Conditional Logic Builder** - Blue highlighted section with:
  - Dropdown to select which answer triggers the follow-up
  - Input field for follow-up question text
  - Auto-creates options for the follow-up question
  - Add/Cancel buttons

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Main questions show at normal level
- Conditional questions show indented with blue left border
- "Conditional" badge on sub-questions
- Collapsed view shows full conditional tree

### 3. Patient-Facing Rendering ✅

**File:** `patient-frontend/components/QuestionnaireModal/index.tsx`

**Conditional Logic Parsing:**
- Supports `answer_equals:value` format (new)
- Supports `question:X,answer:value` format (legacy)
- Automatically shows/hides questions based on user answers
- Real-time evaluation as user selects options
- Handles both single-select and multi-select answers

### 4. UX Improvements ✅

**Form Editor Enhancements:**
- Removed dropdown for step type → Two visible buttons
- Removed title/description inputs → Direct to question editing
- Removed "TYPE: select" label → Auto-uses radio
- Clean header section with form metadata (Name, ID, Status, Created At)
- Left sidebar for adding steps + save actions
- Right column for questions list

## How To Use

### Creating a Conditional Question

1. **Go to Forms Editor**
   ```
   http://localhost:3030/forms/editor/[formId]
   ```

2. **Edit a Question**
   - Click the Edit icon on any question step
   - The question editor opens in auto-edit mode

3. **Add Conditional Logic**
   - Scroll to bottom of the question editor
   - Click "Add Conditional Logic" button
   - Blue section appears with conditional builder

4. **Configure Follow-up**
   - **Trigger:** Select which answer should trigger the follow-up (e.g., "Yes")
   - **Question:** Enter the follow-up question text
   - Click "Add Follow-up Question"

5. **Result**
   - Follow-up question appears indented with blue left border
   - "Conditional" badge identifies it as a conditional question
   - In patient portal, it only shows if trigger answer is selected

## Example Workflow

```
Step 1: "Do you have pre-existing conditions?"
├─ Yes
├─ No

User clicks "Add Conditional Logic":
  Trigger: "Yes"
  Question: "Please list your conditions"
  
Result:
  Main Question: Do you have pre-existing conditions?
    └─ (Conditional) Please list your conditions
       └─ Shows ONLY if "Yes" is selected
```

## Technical Details

### Conditional Logic Format

**New Format (Recommended):**
```
answer_equals:yes
answer_equals:option_1
```

**Legacy Format (Still Supported):**
```
question:2,answer:yes
```

### Database Schema

**Question Table:**
```sql
conditionalLogic TEXT       -- "answer_equals:yes"
conditionalLevel INTEGER    -- 0 (main), 1 (first level), 2 (nested)
subQuestionOrder INTEGER    -- Order within conditional group
```

### API Endpoints

**Create Conditional Question:**
```http
POST /questions
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Body: {
  "stepId": "uuid",
  "questionText": "Follow-up question",
  "answerType": "radio",
  "conditionalLogic": "answer_equals:yes",
  "conditionalLevel": 1,
  "parentQuestionId": "parent-uuid",
  "options": [
    { "optionText": "Option 1", "optionValue": "option_1" },
    { "optionText": "Option 2", "optionValue": "option_2" }
  ]
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `packages/validators/src/question.schema.ts`
2. `patient-api/src/services/question.service.ts`
3. `patient-api/src/main.ts`
4. `fuse-tenant-portal-frontend/pages/forms/editor/[id].tsx`
